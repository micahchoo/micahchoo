### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on -[Open and Collaborative Knowledge](https://github.com/micahchoo/Public-Making)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - HTML+CSS, Making my PKM work for me


## Hi, My name is Micah  

>I work with various collectives learning to nurture conversations, efforts and people. I do this through creative making and facilitating cross-conversations. I work/have worked with these collectives in the domains of open community technology [Janastu,](https://open.janastu.org/), human rights in the inclusive digital [Design Beku](https://designbeku.in/), art-based design practice(Agamashaala), archival, and annotation [Milli](https://www.milli.link/) and creative place-based research undertaken in the Dakkhani region [Living Labs Network and Forum](https://linktr.ee/llnaf).
  
#### What kind of change am I excited by?

>I am excited by situated research that engages with stories from the ground on their own terms as a long-term effect. I am interested in collectives that bring forward alternatives that are more rooted in stories from the ground rather than imposed ideas passed down from positions of hegemony. What does it mean to co-make artifacts that help us imagine anti-capitalist, anti-caste and anti-colonial systems and languages? I would like to humbly play my part in such efforts while considering my privileges and limitations in a lifelong venture.

#### What do I bring to the table?

>I am a researcher, designer, and artist. I enjoy making digital knowledge bases for these collectives and efforts. I am also learning to dabble in code so that I can make it in a bigger variety of ways. I am really good at understanding the nature of different types of information and derive enjoyment from organizing and representing it in different ways.
